# :shopping_cart: online_retail_customer_analysis
An end-to-end customer retention analysis project using online retail transaction data, from data cleaning and RFM segmentation to actionable insights and dashboard visualization.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes online retail transaction data to identify high-priority customer segments and guide retention-focused strategies. The analysis uses RFM-based segmentation to understand customer value concentration, revenue risk, and engagement patterns.

## Business Question
To keep sales growing, online retailers need to truly understand how their customers shop. But treating every customer exactly the same is a recipe for wasted marketing efforts and lower retention rates. That leaves us with one question:

**“How can transaction data help identify which customers matter most and how they should be retained?”**
